/* DTO = Data Transfer Object
	- To modify or alter any property of an object before send to client.

		- like do don't need all the property to send back to user, just need
				cupple of then so we need only send those only.

		- if we need to modify or alter any property name before send to client
				not modify in database level than can be done in DTO.

				doc = {
					_id,
					createdAt,
					updatedAt,
					_v,
					id
					...
				}

				dto = {
					_id,
					createdAt,
					id
					...
				}
